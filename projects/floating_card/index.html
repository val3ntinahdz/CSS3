        <h1>About me <3</h1>
        <h4>Hey! It's Valentina, this is an exercise to practice CSS</h4>
        <div>
            <p>I am fascinated by the fact that everything can be optimized. That's why I love coding.  
                I also love cooking, building things, computer science, female writers, Albert Camus, the color green, neuroscience, photography, languages, design, theatre, aerospace engineering, philosophy, astronomy, geopolitics...  
                and never shutting the fuck up. Quite a lot, but that's just me!</p>
    
            <p>My current favorite quote is from Jean-Paul Sartre: "we are what we do with what they did to us."</p>
    
            <p>Like Sylvia Plath, I have a personal fig tree, meaning I've dreamed of being different women throughout my lifetime.</p>
    
            <p>I adore giving letters to the people I appreciate the most. I absolutely adore puzzles and Legos.  
                My favorite interior styles are Victorian, Japanese, Andalusian (anything Spanish with fun textures and loots of natural light), and Boho.</p>
    
            <p>LOL! Just randomly writing.</p>
